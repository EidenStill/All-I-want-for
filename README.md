## Setup
Database: MySQL

1. Clone this repository.
2. Go into the directory using `cd All-I-want-for`.
3. Install the necessary libraries stated below.
4. Create an empty database in `MySQL`, the table named as `aliwant`.
5. Go into the directories for the client and server, `cd client`, and `cd server` respectively.
6. Run the app locally using `npm start` on both client and server side.
   > This runs the client at `http://localhost:3000`, and the server at `http://localhost:8000`.
8. Open the web app on your desired browser using the URL above.

## Dependencies

These are the necessary libraries that must be installed to run this application locally.

> Note: All values are inferred as strings, and are parsed appropriately in the application. For example `Port` is a string value of 4000, it is parsed to its number counterpart in the application.
